# **Project "TO-DO"**

## üõ† **Installation and Setup**

### **Required Components**

* **Docker** ([Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/))

### **üöÄ Quick Start with Docker**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Innopolis-Robotics-Society/project_fabian.git
cd project_fabian
docker compose up --build <TO-DO>
```

---

## üõ† **Development Guide**

### **1. Local Development (without Docker)**

*TO-DO*

### **2. Development in Docker**

Clone the repository and go to its root directory:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Innopolis-Robotics-Society/project_fabian.git
cd project_fabian
```

Run the container:

```bash
docker compose up --build terminal
```

Connect to the container from other terminals:

```bash
docker compose exec terminal bash
```

### **3. Docker Build**

After making changes to the Dockerfile, you need to build a new image and optionally upload it to the cloud.

Build the image:

```bash
docker build -t image_name -f Dockerfile .
```

Tag the image:

```bash
docker tag image_name fabook/fabian:common
```

Push the image to Docker Hub:

```bash
docker push fabook/fabian:common
```

> \[!IMPORTANT]
> To ensure reproducibility, it is necessary to maintain the Docker image up to date in Docker Hub.
> However, it is not required to run this command every time ‚Äî only when you are confident in your changes.

> \[!TIP]
> The tag can be anything, but by default, `docker compose` uses the `latest` tag.
